This is a vibe-coded (Google Gemini) project. The goal is to help sports fans avoid spoilers for sports that they might be following via Netflix sports documentary series. Think "Drive to Survive", "Six Nations: Full Contact" and similar.

This was inspired by my own experiences - I don't follow Formula 1, but I really enjoy "Drive to Survive".
